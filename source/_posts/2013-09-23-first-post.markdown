I've been meaning to create this site for a while, that is I've been looking in to the most enjoyable way for me to create simple websites. I decided to dive into the world of static site generators for this, instead of just leaning on Wordpress or Drupal to oversimplify everything. I went with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), since it has support for Github Pages, doesn't make you micromanage every step of the site creation, and was designed to be used for blogs.

Along with the [source code for this website](https://github.com/oppenlander/oppenlanderco), you can find [my .emacs.d](https://github.com/oppenlander/.emacs.d) and whatever other projects I am working on. The theme for this site is [Octoflat](https://github.com/alexgaribay/octoflat), though I will likely fork this since there are some small quirks to it I'd like to change.

I'm going to be using this site for project updates and tutorials on topics I've seen lacking. Feel free to leave a comment or email me about how wrong I am about everything I write about.
