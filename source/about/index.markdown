Hi, hello, and other greatings. I'm Andrew Oppenlander and you're on my website, Oppen Source. I am currently a student of Computer Science and Mathematics at University of Cincinnati. This is mostly a place for me to dump my thoughts, motivate myself to work on more projects, and be a general hub for everything I am doing.

Feel free to contact anywhere I might be on the Internet. Though I will say the more your inquiry has to do with giant robots, the more likely I am to respond.
